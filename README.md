Coding Bootcamp - Week 6 - Ajax

The Giftastic assignement was an assignment that I really enjoyed, we were given the task of interacting with the Giphy API, and retrieving GIFS, via the buttons on the page. There was also a requirement to give the user the ability to add buttons as they saw fit, and then fetch GIFS they desired to see. A tricky aspect was ensuring that the page counter didn't reset when a different button was clicked, so that each time the user selected a button, they always recieved 10 new GIFS.
